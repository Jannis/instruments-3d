# 3D CAD models of music instruments and jigs for making them

This repository holds 3D CAD models for custom-made music instruments and jigs
I am using to make them. The models are written using OpenSCAD.

At the moment, models for drums and guitars are planned. Stave snare drums and
Telecaster models for starters and then we'll see.

## Drums

The jigs presented here can be used to make stave shells or shells made
from segments perfectly round from the inside and outside. They are inspired
by the rather fabulous [Murray Drums] ([Murray Drums on YouTube])- check them
out!
